    "To design a complex program, it is often useful to understand its constituent parts.

This equation is true because $\\cos{d}$ is equal to the x-coordinate of the tip of a vector in a unit circle, where $d$ is equal to the counter clockwise angle from the x-axis. Similarly, $\\sin{d}$ is equal to the y-coordinate of the tip of a vector in a unit circle.

    "We can now establish the reference frame for a three dimensional model. This time, the reference frame will consist of three lines: $x$, $y$, and $z$. All three lines are orthogonal to each other. Rotations in two dimensions always involve just one angle: $\\phi$. However, in three dimensions, vectors can be rotated with three angles, each one corresponding to an axis. For example, one might choose to rotate a vector $20\\degree$ about the $x$ axis, $40\\degree$ about the $y$ axis and $0\\degree$ about the $z$ axis. A rotation in three dimensions can therefore be represented with the vector $\\begin{bmatrix}\\theta_{x} \\\\ \\theta_{y} \\\\ \\theta_{z}\\end{bmatrix}$. Rotation around each of the axes requires its own rotation matrix. One can perform the full rotation by multiplying the vector by each of the rotation matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the three dimensional reference frame, $\\vec{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}a_{x} \\\\ a_{y} \\\\ a_{z}\\end{bmatrix}$. If we want to rotate about the $x$ axis, then we want $a_{x}$ to remain constant and $a_{y}$ and $a_{z}$ to change. We can think of this rotation as happening in two dimensions since it remains on a single plane that is parallel to the $y$ and $z$ axes, and we can also think of the $x$ axis as being the origin of the rotation. If we want the coordinates on the $x$ axis to remain constant, we can fill in the values that would make that happen on the $x$ rotation matrix: $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\_ & \\_ \\\\ 0 & \\_ & \\_\\end{bmatrix}$. This leaves four remaining values. Recall that the two dimensional rotation matrix also had four values, and that we are rotating along a two dimensional plane. This means that we can use the values from the two dimensional rotation matrix to fill in the remaining blank spots in this rotation matrix. So, the final rotation matrix for the $x$ axis in three dimensions is $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\cos{\\theta_{x}} & -\\sin{\\theta_{x}} \\\\ 0 & \\sin{\\theta_{x}} & \\cos{\\theta_{x}}\\end{bmatrix}$. We can apply the same principle to the remaining two axes. For the $y$ axis, this gives us $\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos{\\theta_{y}} & 0 & -\\sin{\\theta_{y}} \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\sin{\\theta_{y}} & 0 & \\cos{\\theta_{y}}\\end{bmatrix}$. For the $z$ axis, this gives us $\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos{\\theta_{z}} & -\\sin{\\theta_{z}} & 0 \\\\ \\sin{\\theta_{z}} & \\cos{\\theta_{z}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "We now have the ability to determine what the coordinates of a vector will be if it is rotated about a given axis by a given number of degrees. However, we still have no way to display the vector on a two dimensional surface which gives the illusion that we are seeing it in three dimensions. Although we instinctively feel that we are seeing the world in three dimensions, everything we percieve is actually in two dimensions. We can think of our eyes as cameras in that they exist in a three dimensional world, but display a two dimensional picture. Our goal is to replicate the illusion of the camera.\n",
    "The first obstacle we must overcome is the fact that the same distances are represented differently when conveyed at different angles."

Because we know that $\\cos{\\theta}$ can be negative and that there is no such thing as a negative distance, we can modify this equation slightly by taking the absolute value of $\\cos{\\theta}$. This makes sense because the cross-sectional view of the line rotated $91\\degree$ would not be negative, but would instead be the same as the cross-sectional view of the line rotated $89\\degree$.

    "However, this formula does not tell us how many pixels should be used to represent a particular distance in two dimensions. This is because that number is also influenced by the distance of the camera from the distance. As the distance of the camera from a distance increases, the number of pixels used to represent that pixel decreases. This is why we can see objects in higher resolution when we are closer to them.\n",
    "One way to work around this problem is to split it into two parts. If we knew how many pixels would be needed to represent a distance when the perpspective of the camera is perpendicular and is $x$ units away from that distance, then we would only need to know the fraction of how many pixels would be needed to represent the distance when the camera deviates by a given angle from perpendicular. For example, if we knew that when a camera is perpendicular and 50 units away from a distance, that distance needs 500 pixels to represent it, then if we could figure out the ratio between the number of pixels required to represent that distance when the camera is perpendicular and the number of pixels required to represent that distance when the camera is $30\\degree$ away from perpendicular, we could figure out how many pixels would be required to represent the latter without calculating it directly. This ratio is the ratio between $h$ and $c$, which, according to the formula above, is $1:\\cos{\\theta}$. So, the number of pixels required to represent the aforementioned distance when the camera is $30\\degree$ away from perpendicular and 50 units away from that distance would be $500\\cos{30\\degree}$, which is equal to 250 pixels."

    "**Information about camera orientation**\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, knowing the camera orientation is important because it allows us to determine whether or not the point is on the screen. Ultimately, the final test to see whether a point is on the screen comes down to ensuring that it is within the bounds of several linear functions that collectively comprise the mathematical basis of the square-based pyramid described earlier.\n",
    "There are many different ways that one could conceivebly represent the data for camera orientation. For the purposes of this investigation, the camera orientation will consist of three variables. If all of those variables are equivalent to zero, then it means that a line orthogonal to the surface of the camera would eventually intersect with the origin. This would indicate that the camera is pointed directly at the origin. Each of the three variables in the orientation represents the \"degree of deviance\" on the x, y, and z axes, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us assume that the degree of deviance for the x-axis is $\\theta$ degrees and the euclidian distance between the camera and the origin is $a$ units. A third point, $B$ (with the camera and origin representing the first two points), can be found by skewing the euclidian distance line by $\\theta$ degrees such that if it were extended to infinity, it would intersect with the x-axis. $B$ is the point at which this new line intersects with the x-axis. These three points form a two-dimensional triangular plane, which is shown in Figure __."

    "If we have a camera orientation vector with three variables each representing the degree of deviance from the origin along one axis, then we can determine the equation of the line that runs orthogonal to the lens of the camera, which we will abbreviate as $cam(a)$, where $a$ is the euclidian distance from the camera. Once we have this equation, we can find the four equations that represent the corners of the frame of of the camera.\n",
    "To find the four equations that represent the corners of the frame of the camera, we can imagine at any point along $cam(a)$ a rectangle which has sides than grow linearly in relation to $a$, which is orthogonal to the equation of $cam(a)$, and which forms a plane with the point. We could write this rectangle as an function $rect(a)$, which returns four points that represent the corners of the rectangle at a given point $a$. The rate at which the sides grow is dependent on the vertical and horizontal angles of perception. If you were to take a snapshots of what the rectangle looks like at different $a$ values and overlap all of the snapshots, it would look like the rectangular-based prism described earlier. It is useful to imagine the frame of the camera in this way because if we are given a random point in the vector space, we can find the $a$ value at which $cam(a)$, the random point, and all of the points in the rectangle form a plane. We can normalize the plane to make the math a bit more straightforward and then determine whether the random point is within the bounds of the rectangle. If it is, we can go a step further by determining where on the plane the random point lies in relation to the four corners, and using this information to determine where the point should go on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive $rect(a)$, we first need a way to find a plane that is orthogonal to a given point on a line. If we are given a line which passes through both the origin and a point $\\begin{bmatrix} n \\\\ o \\\\ p \\end{bmatrix}$, in addition to a point $\\begin{bmatrix} i \\\\ j \\\\ k \\end{bmatrix}$, then a plane which contains the point $\\begin{bmatrix} i \\\\ j \\\\ k \\end{bmatrix}$ and is is orthogonal to the line has the equation $nx + oy + pz = ni + oj + pk$. For example, a plane which contains $\\begin{bmatrix} 20 \\\\ 9 \\\\ 16 \\end{bmatrix}$ and is orthogonal to a line which passes through the origin and $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}$ would have the equation $x + 4y + 5z = 20 + 4 \\cdot 9 + 5 \\cdot 16 = 136$, which can be simplified to $x + 4y + 5z = 136$. However, this process can be simplified even further because the point on the plane is the same point through which the perpendicular line passes in this particualar case. In other words, $\\begin{bmatrix} n \\\\ o \\\\ p \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} i \\\\ j \\\\ k \\end{bmatrix}$, which means that the general equation for the plane could be rewritten as $nx + oy + pz = n^{2} + o^{2} + p^{2}$ instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now determine for any $a\\in\\R$ the plane on which the resultant rectangle will lie. The next step is to determine how far away from  $\\begin{bmatrix} n \\\\ o \\\\ p \\end{bmatrix}$ each of the corners of the rectangle is for any $a\\in\\R$. This distance will be the same for all four corners because the center of a rectangle is equally far from all of its corners by definition. However, the distance will change with $a$ because the size of the rectangle, and therefore the distance from the center to the corners, changes with $a$. We can define define this distance as $corner-dist(a, \\theta_x, \\theta_y)$, where $\\theta_x$ and $\\theta_y$ are the horizontal and vertical angles of perception, respectively. "
