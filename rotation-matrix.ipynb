    "#### Finding each frame point for any $a>0$ ####\n",
    "Now, we have a plane that the frame will lie on at any $a>0$ and a distance from a point on that plane that all of the corners of the frame will be. Thus, the possible locations for a corner of the frame at any $a>0$ is a circle with radius $cornerdist(a, \\phi_x, \\phi_y)$ that lies on the plane and has as its center $cam(a)$. The next step is to determine where each of the four corners of the frame lie on the plane at any $a>0$. To do this, we will need to introduce a new variable, $\\phi_r$, which stands for \"roll\". Rolling occurs along the $z$ axis of the camera. If you were to tilt your head from the left to the right, you would be performing a clockwise rolling operation (with a little bit of lateral translation). A head cannot do a $360\\degree$ roll while keeping the body upright because it is secured to the body by the neck. However, a camera *can* perform a $360\\degree$ rolling operation because it is not secured to anything that must rotate along with it. Rolling does not affect the equation for the line extending from the camera, $cam(a)$ because the axis that the rolling occurs on overlaps with $cam(a)$. In other words, when we roll the camera, we are rotating it about the line formed by $cam(a)$. What rolling affects is the orientation of the frame; rolling the camera can change where on the circle mentioned above each of the four frame points lies. When $\\phi_r=0$, the bottom and top of the frame are parallel with the plane formed by the $x$ and $z$ axes. $\\phi_r$ represents the angle between the line orthogonal to the plane formed by the $x$ and $z$ axes and the line intersecting with and orthogonal to both of the lines formed by the top and bottom of the frames."
