This equation is true because $\\cos{d}$ is equal to the x-coordinate of the tip of a vector in a unit circle, where $d$ is equal to the counter clockwise angle from the x-axis. Similarly, $\\sin{d}$ is equal to the y-coordinate of the tip of a vector in a unit circle. Usually, the vector cannot be contained within a unit circle (its magnitude is not equal to 1), which is why both terms are have $r$ as coefficients. This scales the points such that the magnitude of the vector in polar form is the same as the magnitude in coordinate form.\n",

Every axis is orthogonal to every other axis. Rotations in two dimensions always involve just one angle: $\\phi$. However, in three dimensions, vectors can be rotated with three angles, each one corresponding to an axis. For example, one might choose to rotate a vector $20\\degree$ about the $x$ axis, $40\\degree$ about the $y$ axis and $0\\degree$ about the $z$ axis.

The first variable is a an orientation vector $o=\\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_y \\\\ \\theta_p \\end{bmatrix}$. The subscripts $y$ and $p$ represent the words \"yaw\" and \"pitch,\" respectively.
